# Contribution Guidelines for Slirik:

## We welcome contributions from anyone interested in improving our project! Here are the guidelines for contributing:


- Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine.
- If you want to contribute to the Compiler, you will need Java installed. If you want to contribute to the VirtualMachine, you will need Rust installed.
- We recommend using IntelliJ IDEA with a Rust plugin for easier development and debugging with two languages.
- Check the issues tab on the repository to find an issue to work on. All issues for the Compiler are labeled with compiler and all issues for the VirtualMachine are labeled with VM. If both labels are on the same issue, that means development in both is needed to fix it.
- If you want to create or fix something that is not under the issues tab, create a new issue and assign yourself to it.
- Before you start working on an issue, please ask in the issues chat that you want to get assigned. Otherwise, someone else may start working on it before you have a chance to finish.
- Make changes to the code on your local machine, test them thoroughly, and commit them.
- Push the changes to your forked repository and create a pull request with a good title and a detailed description of what you did.
- We will review your pull request as soon as possible and provide feedback or merge it if everything looks good.


## Thank you for your contributions to Slirik!
